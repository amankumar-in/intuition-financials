Below is a **compact, data-heavy sheet** you can lift straight into a deck / memo.
Assumptions are explicit so you can tweak them.

## 1. Round & cap table snapshot (InTuition Exchange only)

### 1.1 Round terms

| Item                        | Value                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Instrument                  | Equity (seed / pre-launch) |
| Amount raised               | **$500,000**               |
| Pre-money valuation         | **$7,500,000**             |
| Post-money valuation        | **$8,000,000**             |
| New investor ownership      | **6.25%**                  |
| Existing holders (combined) | **93.75%**                 |

### 1.2 Simple cap table view (before detailed ESOP)

| Holder group         | % Post-money |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Founders + existing  | 93.75%       |
| New seed investor(s) | 6.25%        |
| Total                | 100%         |

Optional example if you want a visible ESOP in the story (you can adjust):

**Assume pre-round: Founders 80%, ESOP 15%, Advisors 5% (100% total)**

After 500k at 8M post:

| Holder group         | % Post-money (example) |
| -------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Founders             | 75.0%                  |
| ESOP                 | 14.1%                  |
| Advisors             | 4.7%                   |
| New seed investor(s) | 6.25%                  |
| Total                | 100%                   |

## 2. Market size & benchmarks

### 2.1 Crypto exchange platform market (TAM / context)

| Market                                       | 2024 Size      | 2025 Size          | 2033/34 Size        | CAGR                | Source |

### 2.2 India crypto market (strategic focus)

| Market                      | 2024 Size | 2033 Size | CAGR 2025–33 | Note                                           |
| --------------------------- | --------: | --------: | -----------: | ---------------------------------------------- |
| India cryptocurrency market |     $2.6B |    $13.9B |   **18.48%** | Large young user base, strong digital adoption |

## 3. Industry operating benchmarks (for projections & exits)

### 3.1 Fee levels & effective take-rate

| Exchange / data point | Headline spot fees                                                    | Effective revenue / volume signal |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Typical global CEX    | Maker/taker ~0.1–0.2% per trade                                       |                                   |
| WazirX (India)        | 0.2% maker / 0.2% taker                                               |                                   |
| Binance 2024          | Revenue **$16.8B** on volume **$7.3T** → ~**0.23%** effective capture |                                   |
| Coinbase Q1 2024      | Revenue **$1.2B** on volume **$312B** → ~**0.38%** effective capture  |                                   |

**Conservative assumption for InTuition Exchange projections:**
**0.15% blended fee rate** (below large-exchange realised ranges).

### 3.2 Valuation multiples & exits

| Benchmark                                   | EV / Revenue multiple                                                                                                | Notes |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Blockchain & crypto sector median (Q4 2023) | **5.3x** 12-month EV/Revenue (up from 1.9x in 2022)                                                                  |       |
| Coinbase direct listing (2021)              | Reported ~$100B valuation; Q1 2021 revenue $1.8B (annualised $7.2B) → ballpark low-teens revenue multiple at listing |       |
| High-growth DEX examples                    | Up to ~60x revenue in peak narratives                                                                                |       |

**Exit multiple assumptions for you (used below):**
Low 4x, Base 8x, High 12x EV / Revenue.

---

## 4. InTuition Exchange – user & college projections

Assumptions are explicit; adjust as needed.

### 4.1 Colleges

You gave **new colleges per year**:

| Year   | New colleges onboarded | Cumulative colleges (assumes no churn) |
| ------ | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Year 1 | 100                    | 100                                    |
| Year 2 | 500                    | 600                                    |
| Year 3 | 750                    | 1,350                                  |

### 4.2 Users (college ecosystem + open market)

Assumptions:

* Average **active token holders / traders per college** grows as product matures.
* Open-market users grow in parallel.

| Metric                                 | Year 1          | Year 2           | Year 3             |
| -------------------------------------- | --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ |
| Avg active users per college           | 200             | 250              | 300                |
| College-ecosystem active users         | 100 × 200 = 20k | 600 × 250 = 150k | 1,350 × 300 = 405k |
| Open-market active users (non-college) | 10k             | 50k              | 100k               |
| **Total active users (exchange)**      | **30k**         | **200k**         | **505k**           |

---

## 5. Volume & revenue projections (3-year)

Assumptions for trading behaviour:

* Annual traded volume per active user:

  * Year 1: **$3,000**
  * Year 2: **$4,000**
  * Year 3: **$5,000**
* Blended fee rate: **0.15%** (0.0015).

### 5.1 Volume by segment

| Metric                        | Year 1   | Year 2    | Year 3      |
| ----------------------------- | -------- | --------- | ----------- |
| College users                 | 20,000   | 150,000   | 405,000     |
| Open-market users             | 10,000   | 50,000    | 100,000     |
| Volume per user (annual)      | $3,000   | $4,000    | $5,000      |
| **College annual volume**     | $60M     | $600M     | $2,025M     |
| **Open-market annual volume** | $30M     | $200M     | $500M       |
| **Total annual volume**       | **$90M** | **$800M** | **$2,525M** |

### 5.2 Revenue by segment (at 0.15%)

| Metric                          | Year 1    | Year 2     | Year 3     |
| ------------------------------- | --------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| College fee revenue (0.15%)     | $90k      | $900k      | $3,037,500 |
| Open-market fee revenue (0.15%) | $45k      | $300k      | $750k      |
| **Total fee revenue**           | **$135k** | **$1.20M** | **$3.79M** |

**Quick cross-check vs benchmarks:**
At Year 3, $2.5B volume and $3.8M revenue corresponds to ~0.15% effective capture, which sits **below** the 0.23–0.38% realised ranges of Binance and Coinbase, so this stays conservative.

---

## 6. Exit scenarios – 3 and 5 years

### 6.1 Year-3 exit scenario (based on projections above)

Inputs:

* Year-3 revenue ≈ **$3.79M**.
* EV/Revenue multiples: **4x / 8x / 12x**.
* Seed investor stake: **6.25%** (ignoring future dilution for simplicity).

| Case | EV / Revenue multiple | Enterprise value at exit | Seed stake value (6.25%) | Gross multiple on $500k |
| ---- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Low  | 4×                    | ~$15.15M                 | ~$0.95M                  | ~**1.9×**               |
| Base | 8×                    | ~$30.30M                 | ~$1.89M                  | ~**3.8×**               |
| High | 12×                   | ~$45.45M                 | ~$2.84M                  | ~**5.7×**               |

### 6.2 Year-5 exit scenario (simple extension)

Assumption:

* Revenue grows **40% per year** after Year 3:

  * Year 4: 1.4 × 3.79M ≈ **$5.30M**
  * Year 5: 1.4 × 5.30M ≈ **$7.42M**

| Case | EV / Revenue multiple | Year-5 revenue | Enterprise value | Seed stake value (6.25%) | Gross multiple on $500k |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| Low  | 4×                    | $7.42M         | ~$29.69M         | ~$1.86M                  | ~**3.7×**               |
| Base | 8×                    | $7.42M         | ~$59.39M         | ~$3.71M                  | ~**7.4×**               |
| High | 12×                   | $7.42M         | ~$89.08M         | ~$5.57M                  | ~**11.1×**              |

These tables show **what investors get** under conservative, base, and strong execution scenarios.

## 7. Positioning vs other exchanges (leverage narrative)

### 7.1 Comparable exchanges snapshot

| Exchange        | Key metric 2024 / latest                                                        | Notes                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Binance         | Revenue **$16.8B**, volume **$7.3T**, ~150–250M users reported                  | Global leader; shows potential scale.                         |
| Coinbase        | 2024 revenue **$6.56B**; Q1 2024 volume **$312B**, revenue **$1.2B**            | Public market comp; reference for EV/Revenue.                 |
| CoinDCX (India) | Valuation **$2.45B** at latest round; annualised revenue ≈ **$141M**, AUC $1.2B | Shows what a leading India-focused exchange can be worth.     |
| WazirX (India)  | 24h volume ≈ **$0.30M** (~$110M annual)                                         | Illustrates local volume level even with regulatory overhang. |

### 7.2 InTuition Exchange leverage points (data-oriented)

Use bullets, not story, on your slide:

* India crypto market: $2.6B → $13.9B by 2033, 18.48% CAGR
* Global exchange platform market: $33.4B → $88.8B by 2033, 11.2% CAGR
* First-month CFC app: **~500 early users** mining future college coins with zero marketing (your internal metric).
* College pipeline plan: **1,350 colleges live by Year 3**, driving structurally captive order flow to InTuition Exchange.
* Prior exchange experience: you previously ran a Prime-Trust-backed exchange that reached profitability in one month before Prime Trust’s own insolvency and Chapter 11 (shortfall up to $500M, 25k–50k creditors) forced shutdown at the custodian layer . This demonstrates ability to reach profitability quickly with a more resilient custody setup now.

## 8. How to turn this into “charts”

For the deck, suggested charts (based on the tables above):

1. **Chart A – Colleges & users**

   * X-axis: Year 1 / 2 / 3
   * Left axis (bars): cumulative colleges (100 / 600 / 1,350)
   * Right axis (line): total active users (30k / 200k / 505k).

2. **Chart B – Volume & revenue**

   * X-axis: Year 1 / 2 / 3
   * Bars: annual traded volume ($90M / $800M / $2,525M)
   * Line: total revenue ($135k / $1.2M / $3.79M).

3. **Chart C – Exit cases**

   * X-axis: Low / Base / High
   * Bars: Year-3 EV (15.1M / 30.3M / 45.5M)
   * Small labels for seed investor value and multiple.

4. **Chart D – Market size**

   * Stacked or side-by-side bars:

     * Global exchange platform market 2024 vs 2033.
     * India crypto market 2024 vs 2033.

> i want it to be more aggressive growth for users and revenue. This doesnt seem like industry rate for crypto exchanges
>
> we have our traditional growth line like any other exchange PLUS exponential growth because of colleges. And each college also brings in liquidity and assets in form of their coins. They also form exclusivity

Here is an **updated, more aggressive, data-backed sheet** for **InTuition Exchange only**, tuned to:

* Faster user & revenue growth (crypto-style)
* Dual funnel: open market + college tokens
* Still anchored to industry data so it does not look fantasy

Use this as the *numbers* backbone for your deck.

## 1. Round & cap table (InTuition Exchange)

**Round terms (unchanged)**

| Item                   | Value          |
| ---------------------- | -------------- |
| Instrument             | Equity         |
| Raise                  | **$500,000**   |
| Pre-money valuation    | **$7,500,000** |
| Post-money valuation   | **$8,000,000** |
| New investor ownership | **6.25%**      |

**Simple post-money cap table (example)**

| Holder group         | % Post-money |
| -------------------- | ------------ |
| Founders + existing  | 93.75%       |
| New seed investor(s) | 6.25%        |
| Total                | 100%         |

You can overlay ESOP inside “Founders + existing” if needed.

## 2. Market & industry anchors (for “aggressive but sane”)

### 2.1 Market size

| Market                                     | 2024/25 size        | 2033 size     | CAGR       | Source |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------- | ------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Global **crypto exchange platform** market | $33.4B (2024)       | $88.8B (2033) | **11.2%**  |        |
| India **crypto market**                    | $2.6B (2024)        | $13.9B (2033) | **18.48%** |        |
| India crypto users                         | ~100M monthly users | –             | –          |        |

### 2.2 Exchange scale benchmarks

| Exchange / stat         | Users / volume                                                 | Comment                          |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Binance 2019            | 15M+ users; avg daily volume ~$2.85B (~$1T/yr)                 | Example of scale after ~2 years. |
| Binance recent          | ~290–300M users globally; ~$65B daily volume                   | Top-of-market scale.             |
| Coinbase 2013           | 650k users in <1 year (~10k new users/day)                     | Early growth precedent.          |
| Coinbase 2024           | >100M users, 10.8M monthly traders; >$1T volume; $6.2B revenue | Public comp.                     |
| **Avg exchange (2023)** | ~**$45B annual trading volume per exchange**                   | Industry baseline.               |

Our **Year-3 volume in the aggressive scenario (below)** is **$30B**, **less than the 2023 average per exchange**, which keeps the story aggressive but credible.

## 3. Colleges → users → liquidity

### 3.1 Colleges (given by you)

| Year   | New colleges onboarded | Cumulative colleges |
| ------ | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| Year 1 | 100                    | 100                 |
| Year 2 | 500                    | 600                 |
| Year 3 | 750                    | 1,350               |

### 3.2 Users (aggressive growth, dual funnel)

Assumptions (you can tune in the deck):

* Each college brings a growing **active trader base** over time.
* Open-market users scale independently (India + US + others).

| Metric                             | Year 1        | Year 2         | Year 3           |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------- | -------------- | ---------------- |
| Active traders per college (avg)   | 300           | 400            | 500              |
| College ecosystem active users     | 100×300 = 30k | 600×400 = 240k | 1,350×500 = 675k |
| Open-market active users           | 20k           | 160k           | 525k             |
| **Total active users (InTuition)** | **50k**       | **400k**       | **1,200k**       |

This reflects:

* “Normal” CEX growth (open market, 20k → 160k → 525k)
* Supercharged **college-driven funnel** (30k → 240k → 675k)

---

## 4. Volume & revenue – **aggressive exchange scenario**

### 4.1 Per-user trading intensity

Industry context:

* Top CEXs handle trillions in annual volume for tens of millions of users. That implies **tens of thousands of dollars traded per active user per year** in many cases.

Assumptions for InTuition (still below top-tier):

| Assumption                                    | Year 1  | Year 2  | Year 3  |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Avg annual volume per active user             | $10,000 | $20,000 | $25,000 |
| Blended fee rate (maker/taker + other income) | -       | -       | 0.15%   |

0.15% is below realised effective take-rates at Binance (~0.23%) and Coinbase (~0.38%), so conservative on monetisation.

### 4.2 Volume & revenue by year

**Total volume**

| Metric                   | Year 1     | Year 2     | Year 3      |
| ------------------------ | ---------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Total active users       | 50,000     | 400,000    | 1,200,000   |
| Volume per user (annual) | $10,000    | $20,000    | $25,000     |
| **Total annual volume**  | **$0.50B** | **$8.00B** | **$30.00B** |

Check vs industry:

* Industry average volume per exchange (2023): **$45B/year**
* **Our Year-3: $30B**, still **below current average**, leaving headroom.

**Fee revenue (at 0.15%)**

| Metric                   |     Year 1 |      Year 2 |      Year 3 |
| ------------------------ | ---------: | ----------: | ----------: |
| Total annual volume      |     $0.50B |      $8.00B |     $30.00B |
| Fee rate                 |      0.15% |       0.15% |       0.15% |
| **Exchange fee revenue** | **$0.75M** | **$12.00M** | **$45.00M** |

You can optionally add 5–10% extra for listing, market-making spreads, and other income if you want a “total revenue” line. For a clean conservative sheet, you can just show exchange fee revenue.

## 5. College token AUM / liquidity (exclusivity effect)

Assume each college token has a modest but growing circulating market cap, much of whose liquidity is on InTuition.

| Assumption                            | Year 1 | Year 2 | Year 3 |
| ------------------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
| Average college token AUM on exchange | $100k  | $200k  | $400k  |

| Metric                                   | Year 1   | Year 2    | Year 3    |
| ---------------------------------------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| Cumulative colleges                      | 100      | 600       | 1,350     |
| Avg token AUM per college                | $100k    | $200k     | $400k     |
| **Total college token AUM on InTuition** | **$10M** | **$120M** | **$540M** |

This supports your “exclusivity” thesis:

* Hundreds of illiquid, college-specific assets
* Only practical trading venue: InTuition Exchange
* Adds depth and differentiation beyond standard BTC/ETH pairs

## 6. Exit scenarios – **with aggressive revenue**

Using **Year-3 revenue = $45M**, then projecting to Year-5.

### 6.1 Year-3 exit (3-year horizon)

Assume EV/Revenue multiples in the **4–12x** range, inside the band used for high-growth fintech/crypto (some public comps have traded higher).

| Case | EV / Revenue multiple | Enterprise value (EV) | Seed stake (6.25%) | Multiple on $500k |
| ---- | --------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Low  | 4×                    | $180M                 | $11.25M            | **22.5×**         |
| Base | 8×                    | $360M                 | $22.50M            | **45.0×**         |
| High | 12×                   | $540M                 | $33.75M            | **67.5×**         |

### 6.2 Year-5 exit (5-year horizon)

Assume **35% annual revenue growth** after Year-3.

* Year-3 revenue: **$45M**
* Year-4 (approx): ~$60M
* Year-5 (rounded): **$80M**

| Case | EV / Revenue multiple | Year-5 revenue | Enterprise value | Seed stake (6.25%) | Multiple on $500k |
| ---- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ------------------ | ----------------- |
| Low  | 4×                    | $80M           | $320M            | $20.0M             | **40×**           |
| Base | 8×                    | $80M           | $640M            | $40.0M             | **80×**           |
| High | 12×                   | $80M           | $960M            | $60.0M             | **120×**          |

This is the **“what investors get”** table.

## 7. Prime Trust story (track record, risk handled)

For one line in the deck:

* You previously ran an exchange using Prime Trust as qualified custodian.
* That platform became profitable within ~1 month (your internal data).
* In 2023 Prime Trust filed for Chapter 11 with liabilities of $100M–$500M and 25k–50k creditors, after a documented shortfall in customer funds.
* Your current design removes that single-custodian dependency and uses a more resilient custody and on-ramp stack.

This gives investors a **data-point** that you have already built and scaled an exchange once, and failure was infrastructure-counterparty risk, not product-market fit.

## 8. How to convert this into slides

Minimal text, mostly visuals:

1. **Slide: Round & cap table**

   * Table from section 1.

2. **Slide: Market & India opportunity**

   * Two bar charts:

     * Global exchange market 2024 vs 2033
     * India crypto market 2024 vs 2033
   * One line: “100M+ Indians already use crypto.”

3. **Slide: Colleges → users**

   * Dual-axis chart: cumulative colleges vs total users (from section 3.2).

4. **Slide: Volume & revenue trajectory**

   * Bars: $0.5B, $8B, $30B volume
   * Line: $0.75M, $12M, $45M revenue.

5. **Slide: Exit scenarios**

   * Table from section 6 (3-year and 5-year rows side by side).

If you want, I can next assemble these same numbers in **one tight, deck-ready page** (just tables, headings, and short labels) that you can paste straight into PowerPoint or Keynote.
